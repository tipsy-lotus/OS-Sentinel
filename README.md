## 🛠️ Usage

### 📦 Installation

1. Clone this repository and [set up the environment of AndroidWorld](https://github.com/google-research/android_world?tab=readme-ov-file#installation); you may still need to install extra packages needed listed in `requirements.txt` although you have already installed AndroidWorld;

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/OS-Copilot/OS-Sentinel
    cd OS-Sentinel
    # install AndroidWorld
    # requirements.txt contains packages not included by AndroidWorld
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Install Node.js and Appium:

    ```shell
    wget -O install_nvm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.2/install.sh
    bash install_nvm.sh
    nvm install v18.12.1
    npm install -g appium@2.5.4
    npm install -g appium-doctor
    npm install wd
    appium driver install uiautomator2
    ```

3. Run root.py and it will configure the environment of MobileSafetyBench automatically.

    ```shell
    conda activate android
    python root.py
    ```

    and you can run the script of MobileSafetyBench (`msb.py`) under the environment of AndroidWorld.

> [!NOTE]  
> Env `OPENAI_API_KEY` (while `OPENAI_BASE_URL` is optional) is needed when calling external VLM.

### 🔀 Modes

1. `step`: to check safety of single-step action in rule-based and VLM-based manners;

    ```shell
    timestep_new, in_danger = env.record(action)
    ```

2. `record`: to record trajectories of actions proposed by mobile agent.

    ```shell
    timestep_new = env.record(action)
    ```

    this method fix the system states before each action and `env.record("terminate()")` is needed at the end or the last action cannot be recorded.

### 📏 Benchmark

1. Download our trajectories data at [OS-Copilot/MobileRisk](https://huggingface.co/datasets/OS-Copilot/MobileRisk);

2. Extract the zip files and run eval script:

    ```shell
    unzip '*.zip'
    python pipeline/eval.py
    ```

    Don't forget to fill in `_API_KEY`.

    - `pipeline/eval.py` is for typical VLM evaluation;
    - `pipeline/eval_llm.py` is for text-only LLM evaluation;
    - `pipeline/tag.py` is for risk tag evaluation of VLM;
    - `pipeline/cons.py` is for recorded trajectories via mobile agent instead of our hand-made ones;

3. Run `pipeline/multi_method_consistency.py` after `result.json` is ready.
